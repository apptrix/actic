Hi,

This is a very early beta, functionality is currently very limited.

Models implementing this interface will need to offer an 'ical' string field ( t.string :ical ) in the database schema.

    class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
      include ActiveICal::Event
    end

    e = Event.new
    e.start_time = DateTime.now
    e.end_time = DateTime.now + 3.hours
    e.recurrence = "FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10"
    e.description = "Bake Cake"

Will implement a more railsy archicitecture soon ( acts_as_actic )
