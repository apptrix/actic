Actic
=====

This gem fuses ical with ORM, it can be used to create calendar objects and events at the moment,
more subcomponents will be added in time


Example
=======

Hi,

This is a very early beta, functionality is currently very limited.

Models implementing this interface will need to offer an 'ical' string field ( t.string :ical ) in the database schema.

    class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Actic::Event
    end

    event = Event.new
    event.start_time = DateTime.now
    event.end_time = DateTime.now + 3.hours

    event.recurrence = "FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10"
    # OR
    event.recurs :freq => :daily, :count => 10

    event.description = "Bake Cake"
    event.occurrences(:after => DateTime.now, :before => (DateTime.now + 5.days))


   class Calendar < ActiveRecord::Base
     include Actic::Calendar
   end

   c = Calendar.new
   c.add_subcomponent event

Will implement a more railsy archicitecture soon ( acts_as_actic )
