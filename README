Actic
=====
Hi,

This is a very early beta, functionality is currently very limited.

This gem fuses iCalendar with ORM, can be used to make your data model date and event aware.
it can be used to create calendar objects and events at the moment,
more subcomponents will be added in time

Generators
=========

    rails g actic_calendar ### will generate a calendar model and migration with the model name Calendar.
    rails g actic_calendar NuCal owner:references ### you can supply a name and/or additional database fields
    rails g actic_calendar owner:references ### you can supply additional fields and no name!

Or you can generate components at a more granular level

Components
=========

    rails g actic_subcomponent MyEvent event name:string


API Example
==========

Models implementing this interface will need to offer an 'ical' string field ( t.string :ical ) in the database schema. ( if you use the generators you wont need to worry about this )

    class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Actic::Event
    end

    event = Event.new
    event.start_time = DateTime.now
    event.end_time = DateTime.now + 3.hours

    event.recurrence = "FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10"
    # OR
    event.recurs :freq => :daily, :count => 10

    event.description = "Bake Cake"
    event.occurrences(:after => DateTime.now, :before => (DateTime.now + 5.days))


   class Calendar < ActiveRecord::Base
     include Actic::Calendar
   end

   c = Calendar.new
   c.add_subcomponent event


Many Thanks to RubyRedrick ( Rick DeNatale ) for the awesome ri_cal library
